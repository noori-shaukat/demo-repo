# Heading

## Subheading

### Why is this an even smaller heading? IDK Sub-Subheading? lol

### TEXT FORMATTING

Plain Text

**Apparently 2 asterisks or 2 underscores on both sides make the text bold**
__is it bold?__
shortcut is ctrl + B

*1 asterisk or 1 underscore on both sides makes it italicized*
_italicized or no?_
shortcut = ctrl + I

***3 asterisks will make everything all bold and italic***

<sub>this is subscript text. is it tho?</sub>

<sup>this is supposed to be superscript text</sup>

Quoted text is preceeded by a greater than sign ">"
> Like this. it is indented and a different colour

### COLORS
colour can be written as #RRGGBB **or** rgb(R, G, B) **or** hsl(H, S, L)

### LINKS
we can even add links to this?? so cool. I am supposed to write the text in square brackets [] and the link in parentheses ()
like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)

### LISTS
Make an unordered list by preceding lines with "*", "-" or "+"
* this
* is
* a
* list

- this
- too

+ and
+ this

We can also make ordered lists apparently? preceeding them with numbers. I'll just rank universities bec I have nothing better to do
1. MIT
2. Cambridge
3. Oxford
4. Harvard
5. Stanford

### SOMETHING

### CONCULSION

I
