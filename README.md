# Heading

## Subheading

### Why is this an even smaller heading? IDK Sub-Subheading? lol

Plain Text

**Apparently 2 asterisks or 2 underscores on both sides make the text bold**
__is it bold?__
shortcut is ctrl + B

*1 asterisk or 1 underscore on both sides makes it italicized*
_italicized or no?_
shortcut = ctrl + I

***3 asterisks will make everything all bold and italic***

<sub>this is subscript text. is it tho?</sub>

<sup>this is supposed to be superscript text</sup>

Quoted text is preceeded by a greater than sign ">"
> Like this. it is indented and a different colour

colour can be written as #RRGGBB **or** rgb(R, G, B) **or** hsl(H, S, L)

we can even add links to this?? so cool. I am supposed to write the text in square brackets [] and the link in parentheses ()
like [this]()
